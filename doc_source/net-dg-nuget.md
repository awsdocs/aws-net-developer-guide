# Install AWS Assemblies with NuGet<a name="net-dg-nuget"></a>

## Version 2 content \(see announcement above\)<a name="w3aac11c17b3b1"></a>

 [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) is a package management system for the \.NET platform\. With NuGet, you can add the [AWSSDK assembly](http://nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK) and the [TraceListener](http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.TraceListener) and [SessionProvider](http://www.nuget.org/packages/AWS.SessionProvider) extensions to your application without first installing the SDK\.

NuGet always has the most recent versions of the AWS \.NET assemblies, and also enables you to install previous versions\. NuGet is aware of dependencies between assemblies and installs required assemblies automatically\. Assemblies that are installed with NuGet are stored with your solution rather than in a central location such as `Program Files`\. This enables you to install assembly versions specific to a given application without creating compatibility issues for other applications\.

For more information about NuGet, go to the [NuGet documentation](http://docs.nuget.org/)\.

### Installation<a name="net-dg-nuget-install"></a>

To use NuGet, install it from the [Visual Studio Gallery on MSDN](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c)\. If you are using Visual Studio 2010 or later, NuGet is installed automatically\.

You can use NuGet either from **Solution Explorer** or from the **Package Manager Console**\.

### NuGet from Solution Explorer<a name="net-dg-nuget-soln-use"></a>

To use NuGet from Solution Explorer, right\-click on your project and select **Manage NuGet Packages…** from the context menu\.

From the **Manage NuGet Packages** dialog box, select **Online** in the left pane\. You can then search for the package that you want to install using the search box in the upper right corner\. The screenshot shows the `AWS.Extensions` assembly package\. Notice that NuGet is aware that this package has a dependency on the `AWSSDK` assembly package; NuGet will therefore install the `AWSSDK` package if it is not already installed\.

### NuGet Package Manager Console<a name="net-dg-nuget-pkg-manager"></a>

To use NuGet from the Package Manager Console within Visual Studio:
+ Visual Studio 2010 – From the **Tools** menu, select **Library Package Manager**, and click **Package Manager Console**\.
+ Visual Studio 2012 – From the **Tools** menu, select **Nuget Package Manager**, and click **Package Manager Console**\.

From the console, you can install the AWS assemblies using the *Install\-Package* command\. For example, to install the AWS SDK for \.NET assembly, use the following command line:

```
PM> Install-Package AWSSDK
```

To install an earlier version of a package, use the `-Version` option and specify the desired package version\. For example, to install version 1\.5\.1\.0 of the AWS SDK for \.NET assembly, use the following command line:

```
PM> Install-Package AWSSDK -Version 1.5.1.0
```

The NuGet website provides a page for every package that is available through NuGet such as the [AWSSDK](http://nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK) and [AWS\.Extensions](http://nuget.org/packages/AWS.Extensions) assemblies\. The page for each package includes a sample command line for installing the package using the console\. Each page also includes a list of the previous versions of the package that are available through NuGet\.
