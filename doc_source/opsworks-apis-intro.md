# Programming AWS OpsWorks to Work with Stacks and Applications<a name="opsworks-apis-intro"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET supports AWS OpsWorks, which provides a simple and flexible way to create and manage stacks and applications\. With AWS OpsWorks, you can provision AWS resources, manage their configuration, deploy applications to those resources, and monitor their health\. For more information, see [OpsWorks](https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/)\.

The SDK provides APIs for programming with AWS OpsWorks\. These APIs typically consist of sets of matching request\-and\-response objects that correspond to HTTP\-based API calls focusing on their corresponding service\-level constructs\.

For related API reference information, see `Amazon.OpsWorks` and `Amazon.OpsWorks.Model` in the [AWS SDK for \.NET API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/)\.
