# What is the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="welcome"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET makes it easier to build \.NET applications that tap into cost\-effective, scalable, and reliable AWS services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)\. The SDK simplifies the use of AWS services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar for \.NET developers\.

\(**OK, got it\!** I'm ready for a [tutorial](quick-start.md) or to start [setting up](net-dg-setup.md)\.\)

**Note**  
This documentation is for version 3\.5 and later of the AWS SDK for \.NET\. It's mostly centered around \.NET Core and ASP\.NET Core\. In addition to Windows and Visual Studio, it gives equal consideration to cross\-platform development\.  
Documentation for version 3\.0 of the SDK, which is mostly centered around \.NET Framework and ASP\.NET 4\.*x*, Windows, and Visual Studio, can be found at [https://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/sdk\-for\-net/v3/developer\-guide/](../../v3/developer-guide/welcome.html)\.

## Common use cases<a name="common-use-cases"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET helps you realize several compelling use cases, including the following:
+ Manage users and roles with [AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/)\.
+ Access [Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/) to create buckets and store objects\.
+ Manage [Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/) HTTP subscriptions to topics\.
+ Use the [S3 transfer utility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforxamarin/developerguide/s3-integration-transferutility.html) to transfer files to Amazon S3 from your Xamarin applications\.
+ Use [Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/) to process messages and workflows between components in a system\.
+ Perform efficient Amazon S3 transfers by sending SQL statements to [Amazon S3 Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/selecting-content-from-objects.html)\.
+ Create and launch [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html) instances, and configure and request Amazon EC2 [spot instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)\.
