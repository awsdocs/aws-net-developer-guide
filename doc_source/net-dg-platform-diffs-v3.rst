#####################################
Platform Differences in the |sdk-net|
#####################################

The |sdk-net| provides distinct groups of assemblies for developers to target different platforms.
However, not all SDK functionality is available on each of these platforms. This topic describes the
differences in support for each platform.

.. _net-dg-platform-diff-netfx35:

|sdk-net| Framework 3.5
=======================

This version of the |sdk-net| is the one most similar to version 1. This version, compiled against
.NET Framework 3.5, supports the same set of services as version 1. It also uses the same
:ref:`pattern for making asynchronous calls <sdk-net-async-api>`.

.. note:: This version contains a number of changes that may break code that was designed for version 1. For
   more information, see the :ref:`Migration Guide <net-dg-migration-guide-v3>`.


.. _net-dg-platform-diff-netfx45:

|sdk-net| Framework 4.5
=======================

The version of the |sdk-net| compiled against .NET Framework 4.5 supports the same set of services
as version 1 of |sdk-net|. However, it uses a different pattern for asynchronous calls. Instead of
the Begin/End pattern, it uses the task-based pattern, which allows developers to use the new 
`async and await <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh191443.aspx>`_ keywords introduced 
in `C# 5.0 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29#Versions>`_.


.. _net-dg-platform-diff-winrt:

AWS SDK for |WinRT|
===================

The version of the |sdk-net| compiled for `WinRT <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/rt-welcome>`_ 
supports only asynchronous method calls using :code:`async` and :code:`await`.

This version does not provide all of the functionality for |S3| and |DDB| that was available in
version 1 of the SDK. The following |S3| functionality is currently unavailable in the |WinRT|
version of SDK.

* :sdk-net-api:`Transfer Utility <S3/TS3TransferTransferUtility>`

* :sdk-net-api:`IO Namespace <S3/NS3IO>`


.. _net-dg-platform-diff-winphone:

AWS SDK for |WP8|
=================

The version of the |sdk-net| compiled for |WP8| has a programming model similar to |WinRT|. As with
the |WinRT| version, it supports only asynchronous method calls using :code:`async` and
:code:`await`. Also, because |WP8| doesn't natively support :code:`System.Net.Http.HttpClient`, the
SDK depends on Microsoft's portable class implementation of :code:`HttpClient`, which is hosted on
NuGet at the following URL:

* http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Net.Http/2.1.10

This version of the |sdk-net| supports the same set of services supported in the 
|sdk-android|_ and the |sdk-ios|_:

* |EC2|

* |ELB|

* |AS|

* |S3|

* |SNS|

* |SQS|

* |SES|

* |DDB|

* |SDB|

* |CW|

* |STS|

This version does not provide all of the functionality for |S3| and |DDB| available in version 1 of
the SDK. The following |S3| functionality is currently unavailable in the |WP8| version of SDK.

* :sdk-net-api:`Transfer Utility <S3/TS3TransferTransferUtility>`

* :sdk-net-api:`IO Namespace <S3/NS3IO>`

Also, the |WP8| version of the SDK does not support decryption of the Windows password using the
:sdk-net-api:`GetDecryptedPassword <EC2/MEC2GetPasswordDataResponseGetDecryptedPasswordString>` method.

My new proposed change.
