# Simple cross\-platform application using the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="quick-start-s3-1-cross"></a>

\(Go to the [latest developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/quick-start-s3-1-cross.html)\.\)

This tutorial uses the AWS SDK for \.NET and \.NET Core for cross\-platform development\. The tutorial shows you how to use the SDK to list the [Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/) that you own and, optionally, create a bucket\.

## Steps<a name="s3-1-cross-steps"></a>
+ [Setup for this tutorial](#s3-1-cross-setup)
+ [Create the project](#s3-1-cross-create-project)
+ [Create the code](#s3-1-cross-code)
+ [Run the application](#s3-1-cross-run)
+ [Clean up](#s3-1-cross-clean-up)

## Setup for this tutorial<a name="s3-1-cross-setup"></a>

This section provides the minimal setup needed to complete this tutorial\. You shouldn't consider this to be a full setup\. For that, see [Setting up the AWS SDK for \.NET](net-dg-setup.md)\.

**Note**  
If you've already completed any of the following steps through other tutorials or existing configuration, skip those steps\.

### Create an AWS account<a name="s3-1-cross-setup-account"></a>

To create an AWS account, see [How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)

### Create AWS credentials and a profile<a name="s3-1-cross-setup-creds"></a>

To perform these tutorials, you need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user and obtain credentials for that user\. After you have those credentials, you make them available to the SDK in your development environment\. Here's how\.

**To create and use credentials**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. Provide a user name\. For this tutorial, we'll use *Dotnet\-Tutorial\-User*\.

1. Under **Select AWS access type**, select **Programmatic access**, and then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

1. In **Search**, enter **s3**, and then select **AmazonS3FullAccess**\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**, **Next: Review**, and **Create user**\.

1. Record the credentials for *Dotnet\-Tutorial\-User*\. You can do so by downloading the `.csv` file or by copying and pasting the *Access key ID* and *Secret access key*\.
**Warning**  
Use appropriate security measures to keep these credentials safe and rotated\.

1. Create or open the shared AWS credentials file\. This file is `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS systems, and `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` on Windows\.

1. Add the following text to the shared AWS credentials file, but replace the example ID and example key with the ones you obtained earlier\. Remember to save the file\.

   ```
   [dotnet-tutorials]
   aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
   ```

   

The preceding procedure is the simplest of several possibilities for authentication and authorization\. For complete information, see [Configuring AWS Credentials](net-dg-config-creds.md)\.

### Install other tools<a name="s3-1-cross-setup-tools"></a>

You'll perform this tutorial using cross\-platform tools such as the \.NET command line interface \(CLI\)\. For other ways to configure your development environment, see [Install and configure your toolchain](net-dg-dev-env.md)\.

**Required for cross\-platform \.NET development on Windows, Linux, or macOS:**
+ Microsoft [\.NET Core SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/), version 2\.1, 3\.1, or later, which includes the \.NET command line interface \(CLI\) \(**`dotnet`**\) and the \.NET Core runtime\.
+ A code editor or integrated development environment \(IDE\) that is appropriate for your operating system and requirements\. This is typically one that provides some support for \.NET Core\.

  Examples include [Microsoft Visual Studio Code \(VS Code\)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), and [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)\.

## Create the project<a name="s3-1-cross-create-project"></a>

1. Open the command prompt or terminal\. Find or create an operating system folder under which you can create a \.NET project\.

1. In that folder, run the following command to create the \.NET project\.

   ```
   dotnet new console --name S3CreateAndList
   ```

1. Go to the newly created `S3CreateAndList` folder and run the following command\.

   ```
   dotnet add package AWSSDK.S3
   ```

   The preceding command installs the **AWSSDK\.S3** NuGet package from the [NuGet package manager](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/awsdotnet)\. Because we know exactly what NuGet packages we need for this tutorial, we can perform this step now\. It's also common that the required packages become known during development\. When this happens, a similar command can be run at that time\.

1. Add the following temporary environment variables to the environment\.

   **Linux or macOS**

   ```
   AWS_PROFILE='dotnet-tutorials'
   AWS_REGION='us-west-2'
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```
   set AWS_PROFILE=dotnet-tutorials
   set AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

## Create the code<a name="s3-1-cross-code"></a>

1. In the `S3CreateAndList` folder, find and open `Program.cs` in your code editor\.

1. Replace the contents with the following code and save the file\.

   ```
   using System;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   
   // To interact with Amazon S3.
   using Amazon.S3;
   using Amazon.S3.Model;
   
   namespace S3CreateAndList
   {
     class Program
     {
       // Main method
       static async Task Main(string[] args)
       {
         // Before running this app:
         // - Credentials must be specified in an AWS profile. If you use a profile other than
         //   the [default] profile, also set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable.
         // - An AWS Region must be specified either in the [default] profile
         //   or by setting the AWS_REGION environment variable.
   
         // Create an S3 client object.
         var s3Client = new AmazonS3Client();
   
         // Parse the command line arguments for the bucket name.
         if(GetBucketName(args, out String bucketName))
         {
           // If a bucket name was supplied, create the bucket.
           // Call the API method directly
           try
           {
             Console.WriteLine($"\nCreating bucket {bucketName}...");
             var createResponse = await s3Client.PutBucketAsync(bucketName);
             Console.WriteLine($"Result: {createResponse.HttpStatusCode.ToString()}");
           }
           catch (Exception e)
           {
             Console.WriteLine("Caught exception when creating a bucket:");
             Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
           }
         }
   
         // List the buckets owned by the user.
         // Call a class method that calls the API method.
         Console.WriteLine("\nGetting a list of your buckets...");
         var listResponse = await MyListBucketsAsync(s3Client);
         Console.WriteLine($"Number of buckets: {listResponse.Buckets.Count}");
         foreach(S3Bucket b in listResponse.Buckets)
         {
           Console.WriteLine(b.BucketName);
         }
       }
   
   
       // 
       // Method to parse the command line.
       private static Boolean GetBucketName(string[] args, out String bucketName)
       {
         Boolean retval = false;
         bucketName = String.Empty;
         if (args.Length == 0)
         {
           Console.WriteLine("\nNo arguments specified. Will simply list your Amazon S3 buckets." +
             "\nIf you wish to create a bucket, supply a valid, globally unique bucket name.");
           bucketName = String.Empty;
           retval = false;
         }
         else if (args.Length == 1)
         {
           bucketName = args[0];
           retval = true;
         }
         else
         {
           Console.WriteLine("\nToo many arguments specified." +
             "\n\ndotnet_tutorials - A utility to list your Amazon S3 buckets and optionally create a new one." +
             "\n\nUsage: S3CreateAndList [bucket_name]" +
             "\n - bucket_name: A valid, globally unique bucket name." +
             "\n - If bucket_name isn't supplied, this utility simply lists your buckets.");
           Environment.Exit(1);
         }
         return retval;
       }
   
   
       //
       // Async method to get a list of Amazon S3 buckets.
       private static async Task<ListBucketsResponse> MyListBucketsAsync(IAmazonS3 s3Client)
       {
         return await s3Client.ListBucketsAsync();
       }
   
     }
   }
   ```

## Run the application<a name="s3-1-cross-run"></a>

1. Run the following command\.

   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

1. Examine the output to see the number of Amazon S3 buckets that you own, if any, and their names\.

1. Choose a name for a new Amazon S3 bucket\. Use "dotnet\-quickstart\-s3\-1\-cross\-" as a base and add something unique to it, such as a GUID or your name\. Be sure to follow the rules for bucket names, as described in [Rules for bucket naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules) in the [Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/)\.

1. Run the following command, replacing *BUCKET\-NAME* with the name of the bucket that you chose\.

   ```
   dotnet run BUCKET-NAME
   ```

1. Examine the output to see the new bucket that was created\.

## Clean up<a name="s3-1-cross-clean-up"></a>

While performing this tutorial, you created a few resources that you can choose to clean up at this time\.
+ If you don't want to keep the bucket that the application created in an earlier step, delete it by using the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.
+ If you don't want to keep the user you created during tutorial setup earlier in this topic, delete it by using the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/home\#/users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)\.

  If you do choose to delete the user, you should also remove the **`dotnet-tutorials`** profile that you created in the shared AWS credentials file\. You created this profile during tutorial setup earlier in this topic\.
+ If you don't want to keep your \.NET project, remove the `S3CreateAndList` folder from your development environment\.
