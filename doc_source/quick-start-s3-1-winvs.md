# Simple Windows\-based application using the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="quick-start-s3-1-winvs"></a>

\(Go to the [latest developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/latest/developer-guide/quick-start-s3-1-winvs.html)\.\)

This tutorial uses the AWS SDK for \.NET on Windows with Visual Studio and \.NET Core\. The tutorial shows you how to use the SDK to list the [Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/) that you own and optionally create a bucket\.

## Steps<a name="s3-1-winvs-steps"></a>
+ [Setup for this tutorial](#s3-1-winvs-setup)
+ [Create the project](#s3-1-winvs-create-project)
+ [Create the code](#s3-1-winvs-code)
+ [Run the application](#s3-1-winvs-run)
+ [Clean up](#s3-1-winvs-clean-up)

## Setup for this tutorial<a name="s3-1-winvs-setup"></a>

This section provides the minimal setup needed to complete this tutorial\. You shouldn't consider this to be a full setup\. For that, see [Setting up the AWS SDK for \.NET](net-dg-setup.md)\.

**Note**  
If you've already completed any of the following steps through other tutorials or existing configuration, skip those steps\.

### Create an AWS account<a name="s3-1-winvs-setup-account"></a>

To create an AWS account, see [How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)

### Create AWS credentials and a profile<a name="s3-1-winvs-setup-creds"></a>

To perform these tutorials, you need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user and obtain credentials for that user\. After you have those credentials, you make them available to the SDK in your development environment\. Here's how\.

**To create and use credentials**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. Choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. Provide a user name\. For this tutorial, we'll use *Dotnet\-Tutorial\-User*\.

1. Under **Select AWS access type**, select **Programmatic access**, and then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

1. In **Search**, enter **s3**, and then select **AmazonS3FullAccess**\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**, **Next: Review**, and **Create user**\.

1. Record the credentials for *Dotnet\-Tutorial\-User*\. You can do so by downloading the `.csv` file or by copying and pasting the *Access key ID* and *Secret access key*\.
**Warning**  
Use appropriate security measures to keep these credentials safe and rotated\.

1. Create or open the shared AWS credentials file\. This file is `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux and macOS systems, and `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` on Windows\.

1. Add the following text to the shared AWS credentials file, but replace the example ID and example key with the ones you obtained earlier\. Remember to save the file\.

   ```
   [dotnet-tutorials]
   aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
   ```

   

The preceding procedure is the simplest of several possibilities for authentication and authorization\. For complete information, see [Configuring AWS Credentials](net-dg-config-creds.md)\.

### Install other tools<a name="s3-1-winvs-setup-tools"></a>

You'll perform this tutorial on Windows using Visual Studio and \.NET Core\. For other ways to configure your development environment, see [Install and configure your toolchain](net-dg-dev-env.md)\.

**Required for development on Windows with Visual Studio and \.NET Core:**
+ [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
+ Microsoft \.NET Core 2\.1, 3\.1 or later

  This is typically included by default when installing a recent version of Visual Studio\.

## Create the project<a name="s3-1-winvs-create-project"></a>

1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project that uses the C\# version of the **Console Application** template; that is, with description: "\.\.\.for creating a command\-line application that can run on \.NET Core\.\.\."\. Name the project `S3CreateAndList`\.
**Note**  
Don't choose the \.NET Framework version of the console app template, or, if you do, be sure to use \.NET Framework 4\.5 or later\.

1. With the newly created project loaded, choose **Tools**, **NuGet Package Manager**, **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**\.

1. Browse for the **AWSSDK\.S3** NuGet package and install it into the project\.

   This process installs the **AWSSDK\.S3** NuGet package from the [NuGet package manager](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/awsdotnet)\. Because we know exactly what NuGet packages we need for this tutorial, we can perform this step now\. It's also common that the required packages become known during development\. When this happens, follow a similar process to install them at that time\.

1. If you intend to run the application from the command prompt, open a command prompt now and navigate to the folder that will contain the build output\. This is typically something like `S3CreateAndList\S3CreateAndList\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1`, but will depend on our environment\.

1. Add the following temporary environment variables to the environment\.

   In the command prompt, use the following\.

   ```
   set AWS_PROFILE=dotnet-tutorials
   set AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

   Or, if you intend to run the application in the IDE, choose **Project**, **S3CreateAndList Properties**, **Debug** and set them there\.

## Create the code<a name="s3-1-winvs-code"></a>

1. In the `S3CreateAndList` project, find and open `Program.cs` in the IDE\.

1. Replace the contents with the following code and save the file\.

   ```
   using System;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   
   // To interact with Amazon S3.
   using Amazon.S3;
   using Amazon.S3.Model;
   
   namespace S3CreateAndList
   {
     class Program
     {
       // Main method
       static async Task Main(string[] args)
       {
         // Before running this app:
         // - Credentials must be specified in an AWS profile. If you use a profile other than
         //   the [default] profile, also set the AWS_PROFILE environment variable.
         // - An AWS Region must be specified either in the [default] profile
         //   or by setting the AWS_REGION environment variable.
   
         // Create an S3 client object.
         var s3Client = new AmazonS3Client();
   
         // Parse the command line arguments for the bucket name.
         if(GetBucketName(args, out String bucketName))
         {
           // If a bucket name was supplied, create the bucket.
           // Call the API method directly
           try
           {
             Console.WriteLine($"\nCreating bucket {bucketName}...");
             var createResponse = await s3Client.PutBucketAsync(bucketName);
             Console.WriteLine($"Result: {createResponse.HttpStatusCode.ToString()}");
           }
           catch (Exception e)
           {
             Console.WriteLine("Caught exception when creating a bucket:");
             Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
           }
         }
   
         // List the buckets owned by the user.
         // Call a class method that calls the API method.
         Console.WriteLine("\nGetting a list of your buckets...");
         var listResponse = await MyListBucketsAsync(s3Client);
         Console.WriteLine($"Number of buckets: {listResponse.Buckets.Count}");
         foreach(S3Bucket b in listResponse.Buckets)
         {
           Console.WriteLine(b.BucketName);
         }
       }
   
   
       // 
       // Method to parse the command line.
       private static Boolean GetBucketName(string[] args, out String bucketName)
       {
         Boolean retval = false;
         bucketName = String.Empty;
         if (args.Length == 0)
         {
           Console.WriteLine("\nNo arguments specified. Will simply list your Amazon S3 buckets." +
             "\nIf you wish to create a bucket, supply a valid, globally unique bucket name.");
           bucketName = String.Empty;
           retval = false;
         }
         else if (args.Length == 1)
         {
           bucketName = args[0];
           retval = true;
         }
         else
         {
           Console.WriteLine("\nToo many arguments specified." +
             "\n\ndotnet_tutorials - A utility to list your Amazon S3 buckets and optionally create a new one." +
             "\n\nUsage: S3CreateAndList [bucket_name]" +
             "\n - bucket_name: A valid, globally unique bucket name." +
             "\n - If bucket_name isn't supplied, this utility simply lists your buckets.");
           Environment.Exit(1);
         }
         return retval;
       }
   
   
       //
       // Async method to get a list of Amazon S3 buckets.
       private static async Task<ListBucketsResponse> MyListBucketsAsync(IAmazonS3 s3Client)
       {
         return await s3Client.ListBucketsAsync();
       }
   
     }
   }
   ```

1. Build the application\.
**Note**  
If you're using an older version of Visual Studio, you might get a build error similar to the following:  
"Feature 'async main' is not available in C\# 7\.0\. Please use language version 7\.1 or greater\."  
If you get this error, set up your project to use a later version of the language\. This is typically done in the project properties, **Build**, **Advanced**\.

## Run the application<a name="s3-1-winvs-run"></a>

1. Run the application with no command line arguments\. Do this either in the command prompt \(if you opened one earlier\) or from the IDE\.

1. Examine the output to see the number of Amazon S3 buckets that you own, if any, and their names\.

1. Choose a name for a new Amazon S3 bucket\. Use "dotnet\-quickstart\-s3\-1\-winvs\-" as a base and add something unique to it, such as a GUID or your name\. Be sure to follow the rules for bucket names, as described in [Rules for Bucket Naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules) in the [Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/)\.

1. Run the application again, this time supplying the bucket name\.

   In the command line, replace *BUCKET\-NAME* in the following command with the name of the bucket that you chose\.

   ```
   S3CreateAndList BUCKET-NAME
   ```

   Or, if you are running the application in the IDE, choose **Project**, **S3CreateAndList Properties**, **Debug** and enter the bucket name there\.

1. Examine the output to see the new bucket that was created\.

## Clean up<a name="s3-1-winvs-clean-up"></a>

While performing this tutorial, you created a few resources that you can choose to clean up at this time\.
+ If you don't want to keep the bucket that the application created in an earlier step, delete it by using the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.
+ If you don't want to keep the user you created during tutorial setup earlier in this topic, delete it by using the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/home\#/users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users)\.

  If you do choose to delete the user, you should also remove the **`dotnet-tutorials`** profile that you created in the shared AWS credentials file\. You created this profile during tutorial setup earlier in this topic\.
+ If you don't want to keep your \.NET project, remove the `S3CreateAndList` folder from your development environment\.
