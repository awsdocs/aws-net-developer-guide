# Tutorial: Amazon EC2 Spot Instances<a name="getting-started-spot-instances-net"></a>

## Version 2 content \(see announcement above\)<a name="w3aac13c13b9b3b1"></a>

### Overview<a name="tutor-spot-net-overview"></a>

Spot Instances enable you to bid on unused Amazon EC2 capacity and run any instances that you acquire for as long as your bid exceeds the current *Spot Price*\. Amazon EC2 changes the Spot Price periodically based on supply and demand, and customers whose bids meet or exceed it gain access to the available Spot Instances\. Like On\-Demand Instances and Reserved Instances, Spot Instances provide another option for obtaining more compute capacity\.

Spot Instances can significantly lower your Amazon EC2 costs for applications such as batch processing, scientific research, image processing, video encoding, data and web crawling, financial analysis, and testing\. Additionally, Spot Instances are an excellent option when you need large amounts of computing capacity but the need for that capacity is not urgent\.

To use Spot Instances, place a Spot Instance request specifying the maximum price you are willing to pay per instance hour; this is your bid\. If your bid exceeds the current Spot Price, your request is fulfilled and your instances will run until either you choose to terminate them or the Spot Price increases above your bid \(whichever is sooner\)\. You can terminate a Spot Instance programmatically as shown this tutorial or by using the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home) or by using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\.

It’s important to note two points:

1. You will often pay less per hour than your bid\. Amazon EC2 adjusts the Spot Price periodically as requests come in and available supply changes\. Everyone pays the same Spot Price for that period regardless of whether their bid was higher\. Therefore, you might pay less than your bid, but you will never pay more than your bid\.

1. If you’re running Spot Instances and your bid no longer meets or exceeds the current Spot Price, your instances will be terminated\. This means that you will want to make sure that your workloads and applications are flexible enough to take advantage of this opportunistic—but potentially transient—capacity\.

Spot Instances perform exactly like other Amazon EC2 instances while running, and like other Amazon EC2 instances, Spot Instances can be terminated when you no longer need them\. If you terminate your instance, you pay for any partial hour used \(as you would for On\-Demand or Reserved Instances\)\. However, if your instance is terminated by Amazon EC2 because the Spot Price goes above your bid, you will not be charged for any partial hour of usage\.

This tutorial provides an overview of how to use the \.NET programming environment to do the following\.
+ Submit a Spot Request
+ Determine when the Spot Request becomes fulfilled
+ Cancel the Spot Request
+ Terminate associated instances

### Prerequisites<a name="tutor-spot-net-prereq"></a>

This tutorial assumes that you have signed up for AWS, set up your \.NET development environment, and installed the AWS SDK for \.NET\. If you use the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment, we recommend that you also install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\. For instructions on setting up your environment, see [Getting Started with the AWS SDK for \.NET](net-dg-setup.md)\.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Credentials<a name="tutor-spot-net-credentials"></a>

To begin using this code sample, you need to populate the `App.config` file with your AWS credentials, which identify you to Amazon Web Services\. You specify your credentials in the files `appSettings` element\. The preferred way to handle credentials is to create a profile in the SDK Store, which encrypts your credentials and stores them separately from any project\. You can then specify the profile by name in the `App.config` file, and the credentials are automatically incorporated into the application\. For more information, see [Configuring Your AWS SDK for \.NET Application](net-dg-config.md)\.

Now that you have configured your settings, you can get started using the code in the example\.

### Step 2: Setting Up a Security Group<a name="tutor-spot-net-sg"></a>

A *security group* acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed in and out of a group of instances\. By default, an instance is started without any security group, which means that all incoming IP traffic, on any TCP port will be denied\. So, before submitting your Spot Request, you will set up a security group that allows the necessary network traffic\. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will create a new security group called “GettingStarted” that allows connection using the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol \(RDP\) from the IP address of the local computer, that is, the computer where you are running the application\.

To set up a new security group, you need to include or run the following code sample that sets up the security group programmatically\. You only need to run this code once to create the new security group\. However, the code is designed so that it is safe to run even if the security group already exists\. In this case, the code catches and ignores the “InvalidGroup\.Duplicate” exception\.

In the code below, we first use *AWSClientFactoryClass* to create an *AmazonEC2* client object\. We then create a `CreateSecurityGroupRequest` object with the name, “GettingStarted” and a description for the security group\. Finally, we call the `ec2.createSecurityGroup` API to create the group\.

```
AmazonEC2 ec2 = AWSClientFactory.CreateAmazonEC2Client();

try
{
    CreateSecurityGroupRequest securityGroupRequest = new CreateSecurityGroupRequest();
    securityGroupRequest.GroupName = "GettingStartedGroup";
    securityGroupRequest.GroupDescription = "Getting Started Security Group";

    ec2.CreateSecurityGroup(securityGroupRequest);
}
catch (AmazonEC2Exception ae)
{
    if (string.Equals(ae.ErrorCode, "InvalidGroup.Duplicate", StringComparison.InvariantCulture))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ae.Message);
    }
    else
    {
        throw;
    }
}
```

To enable access to the group, we create an `ipPermission` object with the IP address set to the CIDR representation of the IP address of the local computer\. The “/32” suffix on the IP address indicates that the security group should accept traffic *only* from the local computer\. We also configure the `ipPermission` object with the TCP protocol and port 3389 \(RDP\)\. You will need to fill in the IP address of the local computer\. If your connection to the Internet is mediated by a firewall or some other type of proxy, you will need to determine the external IP address that the proxy uses\. One technique is to query a search engine such as Google or Bing with the string: “what is my IP address”\.

```
// TODO - Change the code below to use your external IP address.
String ipSource = "XXX.XXX.XXX.XX/32";

List<String> ipRanges = new List<String>();
ipRanges.Add(ipSource);

List<IpPermissionSpecification> ipPermissions = new List<IpPermissionSpecification>();
IpPermissionSpecification ipPermission = new IpPermissionSpecification();
ipPermission.IpProtocol = "tcp";
ipPermission.FromPort = 3389;
ipPermission.ToPort = 3389;
ipPermission.IpRanges = ipRanges;
ipPermissions.Add(ipPermission);
```

The final step is to call `ec2.authorizeSecurityGroupIngress` with the name of our security group and the `ipPermission` object\.

```
try {
    // Authorize the ports to be used.
    AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngressRequest ingressRequest = new AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngressRequest();
    ingressRequest.IpPermissions = ipPermissions;
    ingressRequest.GroupName = "GettingStartedGroup";
    ec2.AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress(ingressRequest);
} catch (AmazonEC2Exception ae) {
    if (String.Equals(ae.ErrorCode, "InvalidPermission.Duplicate", StringComparison.InvariantCulture))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ae.Message);
    }
    else
    {
        throw;
    }
}
```

You can also create the security group using the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio\. Go to the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/) for more information\.

### Step 3: Submitting Your Spot Request<a name="tutor-spot-net-submit"></a>

To submit a Spot Request, you first need to determine the instance type, the Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\), and the maximum bid price you want to use\. You must also include the security group we configured previously, so that you can log into the instance if you want to\.

There are several instance types to choose from; go to [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance.html) for a complete list\. For this tutorial, we will use `t1.micro`\. You’ll also want to get the ID of a current Windows AMI\. For more information, see [Finding an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/finding-an-ami.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances\.

There are many ways to approach bidding for Spot instances\. To get a broad overview of the various approaches, you should view the [Bidding for Spot Instances](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD9N73F3Fao&amp;feature=player_embedded) video\. However, to get started, we’ll describe three common strategies: bid to ensure cost is less than on\-demand pricing; bid based on the value of the resulting computation; bid so as to acquire computing capacity as quickly as possible\.
+  **Reduce Cost Below On\-Demand** You have a batch processing job that will take a number of hours or days to run\. However, you are flexible with respect to when it starts and when it completes\. You want to see if you can complete it for less cost than with On\-Demand Instances\. You examine the Spot Price history for instance types using either the AWS Management Console or the Amazon EC2 API\. For more information, go to [Viewing Spot Price History](using-spot-instances-history.html)\. After you’ve analyzed the price history for your desired instance type in a given Availability Zone, you have two alternative approaches for your bid:
  + You could bid at the upper end of the range of Spot Prices \(which are still below the On\-Demand price\), anticipating that your one\-time Spot Rrequest would most likely be fulfilled and run for enough consecutive compute time to complete the job\.
  + Or, you could bid at the lower end of the price range, and plan to combine many instances launched over time through a persistent request\. The instances would run long enough, in aggregate, to complete the job at an even lower total cost\. \(We will explain how to automate this task later in this tutorial\.\)
+  **Pay No More than the Value of the Result** You have a data processing job to run\. You understand the value of the job’s results well enough to know how much they are worth in terms of computing costs\. After you’ve analyzed the Spot Price history for your instance type, you choose a bid price at which the cost of the computing time is no more than the value of the job’s results\. You create a persistent bid and allow it to run intermittently as the Spot Price fluctuates at or below your bid\.
+  **Acquire Computing Capacity Quickly** You have an unanticipated, short\-term need for additional capacity that is not available through On\-Demand Instances\. After you’ve analyzed the Spot Price history for your instance type, you bid above the highest historical price to provide a high likelihood that your request will be fulfilled quickly and continue computing until it completes\.

After you choose your bid price, you are ready to request a Spot Instance\. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will set our bid price equal to the On\-Demand price \($0\.03\) to maximize the chances that the bid will be fulfilled\. You can determine the types of available instances and the On\-Demand prices for instances by going to [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) \.

To request a Spot Instance, you simply need to build your request with the parameters we have specified so far\. We start by creating a `RequestSpotInstanceRequest` object\. The request object requires the number of instances you want to start \(2\) and the bid price \($0\.03\)\. Additionally, you need to set the `LaunchSpecification` for the request, which includes the instance type, AMI ID, and security group you want to use\. Once the request is populated, you call the `requestSpotInstances` method on the `AmazonEC2Client` object\. An example of how to request a Spot Instance is shown below\.

```
RequestSpotInstancesRequest requestRequest = new RequestSpotInstancesRequest();

requestRequest.SpotPrice = "0.03";
requestRequest.InstanceCount = 2;

LaunchSpecification launchSpecification = new LaunchSpecification();
launchSpecification.ImageId = "ami-fbf93092";   // latest Windows AMI as of this writing
launchSpecification.InstanceType = "t1.micro";

launchSpecification.SecurityGroup.Add("GettingStartedGroup");

requestRequest.LaunchSpecification = launchSpecification;

RequestSpotInstancesResponse requestResult = ec2.RequestSpotInstances(requestRequest);
```

There are other options you can use to configure your Spot Requests\. To learn more, see [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/TEC2RequestSpotInstancesRequestNET45.html) in the AWS SDK for \.NET\.

Running this code will launch a new Spot Instance Request\.

**Note**  
You will be charged for any Spot Instances that are actually launched, so make sure that you cancel any requests and terminate any instances you launch to reduce any associated fees\.

### Step 4: Determining the State of Your Spot Request<a name="tutor-spot-net-request-state"></a>

Next, we want to create code to wait until the Spot Request reaches the “active” state before proceeding to the last step\. To determine the state of our Spot Request, we poll the [describeSpotInstanceRequests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/TEC2DescribeSpotInstanceRequestsRequestNET45.html) method for the state of the Spot Request ID we want to monitor\.

The request ID created in Step 2 is embedded in the result of our `requestSpotInstances` request\. The following example code gathers request IDs from the `requestSpotInstances` result and uses them to populate the `SpotInstanceRequestId` member of a `describeRequest` object\. We will use this object in the next part of the sample\.

```
// Call the RequestSpotInstance API.
RequestSpotInstancesResponse requestResult = ec2.RequestSpotInstances(requestRequest);

// Create the describeRequest object with all of the request ids
// to monitor (e.g. that we started).
DescribeSpotInstanceRequestsRequest describeRequest = new DescribeSpotInstanceRequestsRequest();
foreach (SpotInstanceRequest spotInstanceRequest in requestResult.RequestSpotInstancesResult.SpotInstanceRequest)
{
    describeRequest.SpotInstanceRequestId.Add(spotInstanceRequest.SpotInstanceRequestId);
}
```

```
// Create a variable that will track whether there are any
// requests still in the open state.
bool anyOpen;

// Create a list to store any instances that were activated.
List<String> instanceIds = new List<String>();

do
{
    // Initialize the anyOpen variable to false, which assumes there
    // are no requests open unless we find one that is still open.
    anyOpen = false;
    instanceIds.Clear();

    try
    {
        // Retrieve all of the requests we want to monitor.
        DescribeSpotInstanceRequestsResponse describeResponse = ec2.DescribeSpotInstanceRequests(describeRequest);

        // Look through each request and determine if they are all in
        // the active state.
        foreach (SpotInstanceRequest spotInstanceRequest in describeResponse.DescribeSpotInstanceRequestsResult.SpotInstanceRequest)
        {
            // If the state is open, it hasn't changed since we attempted
            // to request it. There is the potential for it to transition
            // almost immediately to closed or canceled, so we compare
            // against open instead of active.
            if (spotInstanceRequest.State.Equals("open", StringComparison.InvariantCulture))
            {
                anyOpen = true;
                break;
            }
            else if (spotInstanceRequest.State.Equals("active", StringComparison.InvariantCulture))
            {
                // Add the instance id to the list we will
                // eventually terminate.
                instanceIds.Add(spotInstanceRequest.InstanceId);
            }
        }
    }
    catch (AmazonEC2Exception e)
    {
        // If we have an exception, ensure we don't break out of
        // the loop. This prevents the scenario where there was
        // blip on the wire.
        anyOpen = true;

        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }

    if (anyOpen)
    {
        // Wait for the requests to go active.
        Console.WriteLine("Requests still in open state, will retry in 60 seconds.");
        Thread.Sleep((int)TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1).TotalMilliseconds);
    }
} while (anyOpen);
```

If you just ran the code up to this point, your Spot Instance Request would complete—or possibly fail with an error\. For the purposes of this tutorial, we’ll add some code that cleans up the requests after all of them have transitioned out of the open state\.

### Step 5: Cleaning up Your Spot Requests and Instances<a name="tutor-spot-net-cleaning-up"></a>

The final step is to clean up our requests and instances\. It is important to both cancel any outstanding requests *and* terminate any instances\. Just canceling your requests will not terminate your instances, which means that you will continue to pay for them\. If you terminate your instances, your Spot Requests may be canceled, but there are some scenarios—such as if you use persistent bids—where terminating your instances is not sufficient to stop your request from being re\-fulfilled\. Therefore, it is a best practice to both cancel any active bids and terminate any running instances\.

The following code demonstrates how to cancel your requests\.

```
try
{
    // Cancel requests.
    CancelSpotInstanceRequestsRequest cancelRequest = new CancelSpotInstanceRequestsRequest();

    foreach (SpotInstanceRequest spotInstanceRequest in requestResult.RequestSpotInstancesResult.SpotInstanceRequest)
    {
        cancelRequest.SpotInstanceRequestId.Add(spotInstanceRequest.SpotInstanceRequestId);
    }

    ec2.CancelSpotInstanceRequests(cancelRequest);
}
catch (AmazonEC2Exception e)
{
    // Write out any exceptions that may have occurred.
    Console.WriteLine("Error cancelling instances");
    Console.WriteLine("Caught Exception: " + e.Message);
    Console.WriteLine("Reponse Status Code: " + e.StatusCode);
    Console.WriteLine("Error Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
    Console.WriteLine("Request ID: " + e.RequestId);
}
}
```

To terminate any outstanding instances, we use the instanceIds array, which we populated with the instance IDs of those instances that transitioned to the active state\. We terminate these instances by assigning this array to the `InstanceId` member of a `TerminateInstancesRequest` object, then passing that object to the `ec2.TerminateInstances` API\.

```
if (instanceIds.Count > 0)
{
    try
    {
        TerminateInstancesRequest terminateRequest = new TerminateInstancesRequest();
        terminateRequest.InstanceId = instanceIds;

        ec2.TerminateInstances(terminateRequest);
    }
    catch (AmazonEC2Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error terminating instances");
        Console.WriteLine("Caught Exception: " + e.Message);
        Console.WriteLine("Reponse Status Code: " + e.StatusCode);
        Console.WriteLine("Error Code: " + e.ErrorCode);
        Console.WriteLine("Request ID: " + e.RequestId);
    }
}
```
