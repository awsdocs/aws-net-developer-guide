# Accessing AWS CloudFormation with the AWS SDK for \.NET<a name="cloudformation-apis-intro"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET supports [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/), which creates and provisions AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly\.

## APIs<a name="w155aac21c15c13b5"></a>

The AWS SDK for \.NET provides APIs for AWS CloudFormation clients\. The APIs enable you to work with AWS CloudFormation features such as templates and stacks\. This section contains a small number of examples that show you the patterns you can follow when working with these APIs\. To view the full set of APIs, see the [AWS SDK for \.NET API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/v3/apidocs/) \(and scroll to "Amazon\.CloudFormation"\)\.

The AWS CloudFormation APIs are provided by the [AWSSDK\.CloudFormation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.CloudFormation/) package\.
