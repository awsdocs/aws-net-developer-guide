# EC2 Spot Instance function
This project creates a function and supporting resources:
- src/ec2spot - A C# .NET Core function.
- template.yaml - An AWS CloudFormation template that creates an application.
- create-bucket.sh, deploy.sh, etc. - Shell scripts that use the AWS CLI to deploy and manage the application.

![Architecture](/sample-apps/ec2-spot/images/sample-ec2spot.png)

Use the following instructions to deploy the sample application. For more information on the application's architecture and implementation, see [Managing Spot Instance Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-ec2-tutorial.html) in the developer guide.

# Requirements
- [.NET Core SDK 2.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
- The Bash shell. For Linux and macOS, this is included by default. In Windows 10, you can install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to get a Windows-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash.
- [The AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

# Setup
Download or clone this repository.

    $ git clone git@github.com:awsdocs/aws-net-developer-guide.git
    $ cd aws-net-developer-guide/sample-apps/ec2-spot

Run `create-bucket.sh` to create a new bucket for deployment artifacts. Or, if you already have a bucket, replace `MY_BUCKET` in `deploy.sh` with the name of an existing bucket.

    ec2-spot$ ./create-bucket.sh
    make_bucket: lambda-artifacts-a5e491dbb5b22e0d

# Deploy
Run `deploy.sh` to deploy the application.

    ec2-spot$ ./deploy.sh

This script uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Lambda functions and an IAM role. If the AWS CloudFormation stack that contains the resources already exists, the script updates it with any changes to the template or function code.

The functions in this application are instrumented with AWS X-Ray. Open the [X-Ray console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/xray/home#/service-map) to view the service map. The following service map shows the function managing spot instances in Amazon EC2.

Choose a node in the main function graph. Then choose **View traces** to see a list of traces. Choose any trace to view a timeline that breaks down the work done by the function.

Finally, view the application in the Lambda console.

*To view the output*
1. Open the [applications page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/applications) in the Lambda console.
2. Choose **ec2-spot**.

# Cleanup
To delete the application, run the cleanup script.

    ec2-spot$ ./cleanup.sh
